# Auckland Airbnb Geospatial Analysis & MSA Machine Learning Projects

## üîç Airbnb Accessibility & Attractiveness Analysis (GISCI343 Project)

This project explores the **spatial distribution of Airbnb listings in Auckland**, New Zealand, and analyzes their **accessibility and attractiveness** based on proximity to public transport and parks. The goal is to inform both **travelers** and **hosts** on optimal Airbnb locations by leveraging location intelligence.

### Key Features
- Spatial analysis of Airbnb listings using **GeoPandas**, **PostGIS**, **QGIS**
- Integration of datasets on **bus routes**, **bus stops**, **parks**, and **neighborhood boundaries**
- **Accessibility score** based on proximity to public transport
- **Attractiveness score** based on park proximity and scenic value
- Visualizations: Airbnb density maps, pricing heatmaps, accessibility overlays

### Technologies Used
- Python (GeoPandas, Pandas, SQLAlchemy)
- PostgreSQL + PostGIS
- QGIS for spatial visualization
- Public datasets: Airbnb, Auckland Transport, Auckland Council Parks
